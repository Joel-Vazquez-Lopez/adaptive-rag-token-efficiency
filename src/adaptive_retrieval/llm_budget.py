"""
Main LLM experiment and Safe Adaptive Context model.

This is the most important file in the GitHub project.

It connects the retrieval system to an actual LLM through an OpenAI-compatible
API. For our local experiments, that API is Ollama running Mistral.

What this file does:

1. Builds prompts from retrieved documents.
2. Compresses documents into evidence spans when needed.
3. Calls the LLM or runs a dry-run fake answer.
4. Records provider token counts when the model returns them.
5. Computes answer quality metrics.
6. Runs fixed baselines, adaptive budgets, and Safe Adaptive Context.

The key model:

    answer_aware_fallback_run(...)

Safe Adaptive Context works like this:

1. Choose an adaptive document budget.
2. Try those documents as compact evidence.
3. Score whether the answer looks weak or unsupported.
4. If weak, retry the same documents without compression.
5. If still weak, expand to more documents.
6. Count the full cost, including every attempt.

This is the real model we are evaluating, not a toy imitation.
